# Codey-Cloud
Locally hosted cloud service trying to replicate basic AWS features.

Note: Some of the listed local implementations may be off as they are only intitial plans. This is both a project to demonstrate understanding and abilities but also to learn and do trial and error. Most of the work/time will be on local virtual-machine functinality with the ability for centralised setup and monitoring through the Python3 Tkinter GUI that interacts with the VMware *vmrun* CLI.
